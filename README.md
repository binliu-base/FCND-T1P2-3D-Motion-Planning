# FCND - 3D Motion Planning

# 1. Project Overview
This project is a continuation of the Backyard Flyer project where we executed a simple square shaped flight path. In this project we will integrate the techniques that we have learned throughout the last several lessons to plan a path through an urban environment. Check out the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) for more detail on what constitutes a passing submission.


## 1.1 The 2.5D map of the simulator environment is in colliders.csv

[2.5D map](https://... FIXME)

<!-- # Final Result
Video (https://youtu.be/xWD0j_8Z6gg  FIXME) With this path planner, our drone successfully plan a path through an urban environment and fly around the 2D flight path.
